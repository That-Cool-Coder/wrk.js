# wrk.js

## A multipurpose, flexible, and fast JavaScript library

## Due to a naming conflict, this library has been renamed to [spnr.js](https://github.com/That-Cool-Coder/spnr.js). This repository remains for history's sake.

#### Goals:
- Be fast through simplicity
- Leave no unexpected suprises
- Fill in the holes of p5.js (such as functions not prefixed with p5 and vectors containing the whole p5 instance)
- Have a good name
