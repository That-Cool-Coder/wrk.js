wrk.v()
wrk.v(x, y, z=0)
var v = wrk.v(5, 10)
Return a three-dimensional vector object with values ```x```, ```y```, ```z```. Can also be used to do two-dimensional vectors by omitting the last argument or setting it to 0. Note that the object which is returned has no prototype and must be acted upon by the ```wrk.v``` functions.

wrk.v.random()
wrk.v.random(min, max, floatsAllowed=true)
var v = wrk.v.random(wrk.v(0, 0), wrk.v(10, 10), false)
Create a ```wrk.v``` with x in the range of ```min.x``` to ```max.x```, and the equivalent for ```y``` and ```z```. If ```floatsAllowed``` is false, the components of the output vector will be integers. Otherwise they may be integers or floats.
