## Code Writing Guidelines for wrk.js

[Back to README](/README.md)  

#### Simple guidelines
- 4 spaces indentation
- Don't sacrifice readibility unless you HAVE TO for efficiency (include a more readable but functionally identical copy in a block comment above with a note)
- If you have to leave a piece of code half-baked for some reason, put a comment near it that contains ```!FIXME``` so it can be found in a search-and-replace and fixed
