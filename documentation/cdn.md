[Back to README](/README.md)  

#### Brief Description
The ```/cdn``` folder is a folder for a repl-based cdn. It holds subfolders which correspond to the github wrk.js releases. Each subfolder should be names along the lines of ```0.1.0```. Don't put a 'v' at the start of the folder name. Each subfolder should hold a file called ```wrk.js```, which is the main compiled file. It should be identical to the version on the github release. In future versions, minified versions may also be in the folders
