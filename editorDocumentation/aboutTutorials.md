## The tutorials folder of wrk.js

[Back to README](/README.md)

#### Introduction
While the the user reference is useful, some parts of wrk need more detailed instructions. For instance, the user reference does not help much with the game engine, as it gives no insight into the general organisation and how to setup a project.

#### Format
Currently, the tutorials are made in markdown - plain text would be too limiting and HTML would be to free.
